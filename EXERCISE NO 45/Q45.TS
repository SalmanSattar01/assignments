//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. 
//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
//Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...options: { [key: string]: any }): object {
    let car: { manufacturer: string, model: string, [key: string]: any } = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };

    // Assign other provided options to the car object
    for (let key in options) {
        car[key] = options[key];
    }

    return car;

// Call the function with required information and additional options
let myCar = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", {color: "blue", year: 2023});

// Print the returned object to verify all information was stored correctly
console.log(myCar);
