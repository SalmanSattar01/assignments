//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guestList = ["Shoaib", "Shahzad", "Zeeshan"];
guestList.forEach(function (person) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(person, ",\n\nI would like to invite you to dinner at my place. It would be an honor to have you join us for an evening of delightful conversation and delicious food.\n\nPlease let me know if you're available.\n\nBest regards,\nSalman Sattar"));
