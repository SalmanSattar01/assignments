//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// Define an array containing the names of continents

    "Africa",
    "Antarctica",
    "Asia",
    "Europe",
    "North America",
    "Australia (Oceania)",
    "South America"
